add this to your actual ~/.vimrc
"
set runtimepath+=~/etc/wittekm-vim/
let dotvim='~/etc/wittekm-vim'      
source ~/etc/wittekm-vim/dotvimrc   
"

also you're gonna have to reinstall all those bundles but whatever


actually i'm thinking that a symbolic link might be a better way to go truthfully since idk how to make vundle not clone into .vim
